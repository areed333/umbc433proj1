#Added information from in class project work
OVERALL STRATEGY FOR RESOURCE UTILIZATION:
 
 HTML and CSS will be used for the front end to visualize the student data (i.e. unique 
  student information and courses students have taken and will be able to take in the 
  future). 

 JavaScript will be used to handle user interaction with the program.

 PHP will be used for communicating information between the student input (i.e. unique 
  student information and courses students have taken) and the database. 

 The mySQL database will store both the classes students have already taken as well as 
  the courses the students will be able to take. The stored information will determine 
  what classes a student can take. We are also thinking of working on an algorithm 
  to determine, based on what grade a student received in a course, what other courses, 
  if these courses are electives, the ones that would be in the best interest of the 
  student to take. 


TIMELINE FOR PROJECT TASK COMPLETION:

 3/3/16 - 3/17/16 (2 weeks)
   Front end of project completed
   -form for student information
   -each aspect of information in sections 1 and 2 (e.g. student name for section 1 and course name for section 2) will be input 
    in an input form field
   -home page to be divided into 2 main sections 
    i.e. bordered off sections that contain information
    
   ->Section 1 of the home page (front-end development) will contain student-unique information
   
    Name
    Campus ID
    Email address 
    Contact number

   ->Section 2 of the home page (front-end development for display of courses) will contain classes student has taken
    Section 2 of the home page will also involve back-end development for keeping track of courses taken
    to determine what courses the student can take the next semester

    Course name (Syntax: Acronym based on course type and course number)
    -In these course name input fields, example of the syntax of the course entry
    -If student enters in incorrect input (e.g. English for Literary Students) as opposed to ENGL333)
     message will appear telling student to enter in correctly formatted information

 3/18/16 - 3/25/16 (1 weeks)
   Back-end of project for storing classes student has currently taken
   -Student information stored in database
   -Incorporating student information entered

 3/26/16 - 4/9/16 (2 weeks)
   Back-end of project for storing what classes student can take next semester completed
   Planned finished date for having programming
   aspect of project completed: March 31st 

 4/10/16 - 4/12/16
   Review all of code and program functionality and fix any bugs or issues
